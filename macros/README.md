# Instructions
There are two macros here:
 * plotVar.C - This macro plots the pT of the lepton and displays it
 * printYield.C - This macroprints the number of events and the number of events after a basic selection

Both macros are to be executed using the root interpreter.
The macros can be run in either compiled or interactive mode, I recommend usng the compiled mode since it avoids some of the pitfalls of using the root interpreter.
 * compiled - Use the command `root [macro_name]+`
 * interactive - Use the command `root [macro_name]`
