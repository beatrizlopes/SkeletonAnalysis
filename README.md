# SkeletonAnalysis
Codebase of a skeleton HEP analysis using ROOT, com alteracoes.

There are two versions of the code, one using macros, which require the ROOT interpreter and are run through the ROOT interpreter.
The other version uses standalone binaries.
I personally recommend using the standalone binaries since in this situation an actual compiler is used to compile the code and better compliance to the c++ standards is thus ensured.
