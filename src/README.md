# Instructions
There are two source codes here:
 * plotVar.cc - This one plots the pT of the lepton and displays it
 * printYield.cc - This one prints the number of events and the number of events after a basic selection

To compile them, run `make`.
Do not forget to run the thisroot script before running make (`. $ROOTSYS/bin/thisroot.sh`).
After compiling they can be run like any other compiled binary.
